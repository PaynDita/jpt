unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > combined.txt

john combined.txt 
OR
john combined.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/password
----------------------------------------------------------------
Here if we need for one user only then we could select that user only
cat /etc/passwd  - copy root and paste to new file rootuser.txt
cat /etc/shadow - copy root hash value and paste to new file roothash.txt

unshadow rootuser.txt roothash.txt > combined.txt
john combined.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/password

The unshadow command is part of the John the Ripper suite and is used to combine the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files into a single file that can be used for password cracking. 
This is necessary because the /etc/passwd file contains user information (including usernames) but does not contain password hashes, while the /etc/shadow file contains password hashes but is only accessible by 
the root user OR ROOT USER PRIVILEDGE

Here's a clear example of how to use the unshadow command:

Steps to Use unshadow:
Obtain the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow Files:

These files are typically located in /etc/ on most Linux systems.
You must have root privileges to access the /etc/shadow file.
Run the unshadow Command:

The unshadow command combines both files into a single file that can be used for password cracking.
Example Command Line:
bash
Copy code
sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > combined.txt
Explanation:
sudo: This is required because you need root access to read the /etc/shadow file.
unshadow: This is the command to combine the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
/etc/passwd: This file contains user account information such as usernames.
/etc/shadow: This file contains the hashed passwords (which are secured and only accessible by the root user).
> combined.txt: This redirects the output of the combined file to a new file called combined.txt.
Output:
The combined.txt file will contain an entry for each user in the following format:

css
Copy code
username:hashed_password:last_change:min_age:max_age:warn_period:inactive_period:expire_date:reserved_field
For example, an entry might look like:

ruby
Copy code
root:$6$abcd1234$Hk...hashed_part...Uj:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
user:$6$efgh5678$Hk...another_hash...Gj:1000:1000:User:/home/user:/bin/bash
root: The username.
$6$abcd1234$...: The hashed password (in this case, it's a SHA-512 hash).
/root: The home directory of the user.
/bin/bash: The user's default shell.
Using the Combined File for Cracking:
After combining the files using unshadow, you can use John the Ripper to crack the password hashes:

bash
Copy code
john combined.txt
This will start cracking the hashes in combined.txt using John the Ripper.

Important Notes:
Permissions: You must be root (or have root privileges) to access the /etc/shadow file.
Legality: Make sure that you have permission to access these files. Cracking passwords without authorization is illegal.
John the Ripper: Ensure that John the Ripper is installed on your system before using it to crack passwords.
