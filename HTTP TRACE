HTTP TRACE with Nmap:
If you're looking to specifically identify if HTTP TRACE is enabled, you can use the http-methods script like this:

nmap -p 80 --script=http-methods <target>
This command will focus on port 80 (common for HTTP) and check for the methods that are allowed, including TRACE.

Example Output:
If TRACE is enabled, you'll see output like this:

80/tcp open  http
| http-methods: 
|   Supported Methods: GET POST OPTIONS TRACE
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE

This output shows that TRACE is enabled and might be considered risky.
