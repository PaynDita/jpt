Pivoting is a technique used during penetration testing (or attacks) to move laterally across a network. It allows a tester (or attacker) to use a compromised 
machine as a stepping stone to access other systems or parts of the network that would otherwise be inaccessible. Here's a clear explanation with a real-world example:

Scenario:
You’re performing a penetration test for a company.

The company's network has two segments:
Internal Employee Network (Segment A): Only accessible to employees and not directly exposed to the internet.
Critical Systems Network (Segment B): Contains sensitive servers (e.g., databases, financial systems) and is accessible only from Segment A.


During your test, you exploit a vulnerability in a web application that’s exposed to the internet (e.g., SQL injection or RCE). This gives you access to a web
server in Segment A.

Local Enumeration:
You discover that the compromised web server is dual-homed (connected to both Segment A and Segment B).
You identify that you don’t have direct access to Segment B from your attacking machine.

Set Up Pivoting:
You deploy a tool like Meterpreter, SSH tunneling, or SOCKS proxy on the compromised web server.
This allows you to use the compromised server as a gateway to communicate with Segment B.

Lateral Movement:
Using your pivot, you scan Segment B from the compromised server and find an unpatched database server.
You exploit this server (e.g., by using a misconfigured service or an outdated vulnerability).

Access Sensitive Data:
After compromising the database server, you exfiltrate sensitive company information such as financial records or customer data.

Key Insights from the Example:
Why Pivoting Matters: Without pivoting, you would not be able to access Segment B directly because it’s isolated from the external network.

Realistic Tools for Pivoting:
SSH Tunneling: Forwarding traffic from your machine to the target network via the compromised server.
SOCKS Proxy (e.g., using proxychains): To route tools like nmap or msfconsole through the pivot.
Post-Exploitation Frameworks: Tools like Metasploit's Meterpreter allow you to establish routes and pivot easily.


 Here's a step-by-step example of using proxychains for pivoting during a penetration test. This will include clear commands and explanations.

Scenario:
You’ve compromised a Linux server (192.168.1.100) in a Target Network A using SSH access. Your goal is to pivot into a Target Network B (10.10.10.0/24),
which is only accessible from within Target Network A.

Setup Overview:
Your Machine (Attacker): Kali Linux at IP 10.0.0.1
Compromised Server: 192.168.1.100 (dual-homed, connected to both 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.10.10.0/24)
Target Subnet: 10.10.10.0/24 (reachable only through the compromised server)

1. Install Proxychains on Kali Linux
Make sure Proxychains is installed on your attacking machine:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install proxychains

2. SSH into the Compromised Server with Dynamic Port Forwarding
Use SSH to set up a SOCKS proxy that listens on your local machine. This will allow you to route traffic through the compromised server.

ssh -D 9050 user@192.168.1.100

-D 9050: This creates a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 of your attacking machine.
user@192.168.1.100: The SSH username and IP address of the compromised server.
Keep this session running in a terminal. This acts as your pivot point.

3. Configure Proxychains
Edit the Proxychains configuration file to point to the SOCKS proxy:

sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf

Find the following line and ensure it is uncommented:

socks5  127.0.0.1 9050
Save and exit the file.

4. Use Proxychains for Scanning the Internal Network
Now, route your scanning tools through Proxychains to access the internal network (10.10.10.0/24).

4.1. Nmap Scan
Run an nmap scan through Proxychains:

proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n 10.10.10.0/24

proxychains: Forces all traffic through the SOCKS proxy you set up.
-sT: TCP connect scan (required because SYN scan may not work through proxies).
-Pn: Disable host discovery (treat all hosts as online).
-n: Skip DNS resolution.
This will scan the internal subnet (10.10.10.0/24) for open ports and services.

4.2. Access an Internal Service (e.g., SSH)
Let’s say you find an SSH service running on 10.10.10.50 (port 22). You can connect to it using Proxychains and an SSH client:

proxychains ssh user@10.10.10.50

This routes your SSH traffic through the compromised server.

4.3. Browse an Internal Web Server
If you discover a web service running on 10.10.10.20 (port 80), you can use a web browser to access it. Launch your browser through Proxychains like this:

proxychains firefox http://10.10.10.20

5. Automate Other Tools Through Proxychains
You can use Proxychains to route any tools that support TCP, including:

Metasploit Framework:
proxychains msfconsole

Netcat:
proxychains nc -vz 10.10.10.50 22

SQLmap:
proxychains sqlmap -u "http://10.10.10.20/vulnerable.php?id=1"

Summary of Key Commands
Set up SOCKS proxy:
ssh -D 9050 user@192.168.1.100

Edit Proxychains config:
sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf

Run tools through Proxychains:

Nmap:
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n 10.10.10.0/24

SSH:
proxychains ssh user@10.10.10.50

Web Browsing:
proxychains firefox http://10.10.10.20

Key Notes:
Proxychains supports both SOCKS4/5 and HTTP proxies.
Some tools (e.g., nmap -sS for SYN scan) may not work correctly through a proxy.
Always test your pivot to ensure traffic is being routed as expected.

Let’s dive deeper into testing and troubleshooting the Proxychains setup to ensure everything works smoothly. Here’s how you can verify and troubleshoot each step in your pivoting setup.

Step-by-Step Testing
1. Test SSH SOCKS Proxy Connection
To verify that your SOCKS proxy (ssh -D 9050 user@192.168.1.100) is working, perform these checks:

a. Use curl to Test Connectivity
Run the following command to test if traffic is being routed through the proxy:

bash
Copy code
proxychains curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com
This should return the public IP address of the compromised server (192.168.1.100), not your local machine.
b. Check Proxychains Logs
Run any Proxychains-enabled command with debugging enabled:

bash
Copy code
proxychains -f /etc/proxychains.conf -q curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com
This will display a detailed log of how traffic is routed through the proxy. Look for SOCKS connection messages.
2. Verify Access to Internal Targets
Use a simple tool like ping or telnet (routed through Proxychains) to test connectivity to the internal subnet:

a. Ping an Internal Host
bash
Copy code
proxychains ping 10.10.10.1
If this fails (because ICMP isn’t proxied), try a TCP-based method instead.

b. Check if Ports are Open
Use nc (Netcat) to see if a specific port is open on an internal target:

bash
Copy code
proxychains nc -vz 10.10.10.50 22
Expected Output: If successful, you’ll see a message like Connection to 10.10.10.50 22 port [tcp/ssh] succeeded!.
3. Scan the Internal Network with Nmap
If you’re having issues with scanning, consider the following:

a. Use TCP Connect Scan (-sT)
The SYN scan (-sS) may not work through Proxychains. Use this instead:

bash
Copy code
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n 10.10.10.0/24
b. Limit Open Ports Scanned
Scanning all 65,535 ports can be slow through a proxy. Limit it to common ports:

bash
Copy code
proxychains nmap -p 22,80,443 -Pn 10.10.10.0/24
c. Debug Nmap Output
Enable debugging to see where the scan might be failing:

bash
Copy code
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn -n --packet-trace 10.10.10.0/24
4. Test Web Access
If you’re trying to access an internal web server (http://10.10.10.20), here’s how to verify the connection:

a. Use Curl for Web Requests
bash
Copy code
proxychains curl http://10.10.10.20
If successful, this will return the HTML of the internal web page.
b. Use Proxychains with Firefox
Launch Firefox through Proxychains to visually test the web application:

bash
Copy code
proxychains firefox http://10.10.10.20
If the page doesn’t load, verify:

The SOCKS proxy (9050) is correctly configured in /etc/proxychains.conf.
The compromised server has access to the target subnet.
Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. Proxychains Not Routing Traffic
If Proxychains isn’t routing traffic as expected:

Check the configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf
Ensure the correct proxy type and IP are set:

bash
Copy code
socks5  127.0.0.1 9050
Test connectivity with curl and Proxychains debugging:

bash
Copy code
proxychains -f /etc/proxychains.conf -q curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com
2. Nmap Scans Are Slow or Failing
Reduce the port range to common ports:

bash
Copy code
proxychains nmap -p 22,80,443 -Pn 10.10.10.0/24
Use -T4 for faster timing:

bash
Copy code
proxychains nmap -sT -T4 -Pn -n 10.10.10.0/24
3. Tools Not Working Through Proxychains
Some tools don’t natively support proxies or behave inconsistently. In such cases:

Use a proxy-aware tool like proxychains or proxies.
Alternatively, use SSH's built-in port forwarding (-L or -R flags) to forward traffic instead of Proxychains.
4. Access Denied or Connectivity Blocked
Verify:

The compromised server has access to the target network.
No firewall rules are blocking outbound connections from the compromised server.
Testing in a Controlled Lab
If you're preparing for a pentest or practicing for CPENT, consider setting up a controlled lab environment:

Set Up a Dual-Homed Machine:
Create a VM with two network interfaces (one connected to your "internal" network, one to the "external" network).
Simulate Multiple Subnets:
Use tools like VirtualBox or VMware to isolate subnets and practice pivoting.
Practice with Common Tools:
Use Metasploit, Proxychains, or SSH tunneling in your lab to explore pivoting scenarios.
